# Final Project Reflection
For the process of building the application there were certain tools that we used and conventions we followed. The main tools we used were Jira, Github, Facbook Messenger, and Google Documents. We would use Jira to manage our tasks, Github for our code repository,  Messenger for communication/daily standups, and Google docs for sharing documents. Furthermore, we would aim to meet around once a week and conduct our reflections in person after demoing our product at the end of each sprint. We found this process to be highly effective because it kept us organized, enabled us to communicate well, and ensured we reflected on our product to keep up with deadlines. One minor fall back was caused by the inability for us to connect Jira with Github. It would have been better if it was possible so that we could manage our branches directly on Jira and with their corresponding tasks. We overcame this by having branch names that reflected the story/task and adding an identifier for the tasks (TEAM-##) in our commit messages.
