    - was fine
- user functionality                                                                                    (3/3)
    - login / registration
    - can view posts that a user has made
    - cannot edit profiles
        - API exists but is not implemented into the frontend
- viewing fandoms                                                                                       (3/3)
    - interface is generally ok; some things look really nice and some are a little laclustre
        - feed without any posts could use some more work
            - perhaps like a placeholder or something suggesting you to join a fandom
        - could have cropped profile image as opposed to stretching it
    - can view different fandoms
    - can join different fandoms
- interacting with fandoms                                                                              (3/3)
    - can post to a fandom
    - creating a new fandom is not possible currently
        - API exists but not implemented into the frontend (intentional decision to remove functionality)
